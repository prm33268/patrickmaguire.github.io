	<h4 style="font-size: 18pt"> First Season </h4>
	<p> The Georgia football team has had an interesting season with new head coach, Kirby Smart.
	Smart coming from his position as Defensive coordinator at the University of Alabama brought high energy and new hope for the team. 
	Last spring at the G day game the excitement was evident as over 93,000 people attended the scrimmage. 
	This anticipation and excitement has been carried throughout the season even though there have 
	been constant highs and lows. This includes losing to Vandy at home and the heartbreaking 
	ending of Tennessee, but also beating a 9th ranked Auburn and the UNC Tar Heels in the season kickoff. </P>
	<p> Throughout the season there has also been a strong emphasis on improving the young players in 
	the program. Freshman quarterback, Jacob Eason, made an appearance in the season opener in the Georgia
	dome and immediately brought a new presence to the field. Some have compared him to Matthew Stafford,
	quarterback of the Detroit Lions. Eason brought a new threat with the deep ball which in turn improved the run game for the dynamic backfield of the bulldogs made up of Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, and freshman
	Brian Herrian. There have been many standout moments and points of leadership for the freshman
	quarterback and coach Smart has said that he has seen great progress. He believes one of Eason's
	best and most valuable qualities is his composure and ability to handle the big moment. Eason
	and Coach Smart are on their way to leading this young team to a bowl game to finish the season. </p>

	<p>These freshman have led the team in many aspects of the game.  This includes everything from
	Eason and Nauta on the offensive side of the ball all the way to Blankenship and Hardman on special
	teams. They have also played a large part in building the future of our program.  Many recruits have 
	said in interviews that they really appreciate the way the younger guys are included in the program.
	Coach Smart has also played a large part in taking these kids one year out of high school and making 
	them hard workers for the program, but also positive members on campus. The future is looking bright 
	for Coach Smart and the Bulldogs. </p>
